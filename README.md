# eike-holz.de

The code behind the [personal website of Eike Holz](https://www.eike-holz.de).

Only the `.html`, `.png` and `.ico` files in this root directory need to be deployed to a live server. Other files (in the `dev` directory) were only needed during the development process, e.g. to create a data URL for the font which was ultimately inlined in [index.html](./index.html).
